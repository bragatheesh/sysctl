Design an interface to /proc/sys that uses sockets
to modify and/or poll system parameters by our DPDK applications.

The program will feature the ability to register a command which will
a directory key within the application to its corresponding directory 
on the system. 

Passing this registered key into either read or write functions will
enable the user to manipulate the data from /proc/sys.
